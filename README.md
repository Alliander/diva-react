# Note new IRMA server:

The version in this branch had been refactored to support the new IRMA protocol. With this change, Diva doesn't require a backend anymore. Specify the URL to your IRMA server in `src/sagas/index.js` and run it with the new-irma branch of diva-js-reference-3p-frontend.

Notable absent features:
- No session support (still uncertain whether we will add that again)
- No Authenticated IRMA JWT issue/disclose support (will be implemented)

# diva-react

This repository contains a library that can be used with the DIVA backend SDK [diva-irma-js](https://github.com/Alliander/diva-irma-js) to easily integrate [IRMA attributes](https://privacybydesign.foundation/irma-verifier/) into React based applications.

See [diva-js-reference-3p-frontend](https://github.com/Alliander/diva-js-reference-3p-frontend) for an example implementation of this library that also makes use of [diva-js-reference-3p-backend](https://github.com/Alliander/diva-js-reference-3p-backend) as an example backend with [diva-irma-js](https://github.com/Alliander/diva-irma-js).

IRMA is a decentralized, attribute based Identity Management protocol that allows easy and fine-grained authentication (and based on specific attributes) authorization. Attributes are issued by trusted issuers and therefore provide easy validation of users.

## Features

This library can be used in a React frontend to create and visualise IRMA disclosure, issuing and signing sessions.

This library allows you to:
- Only show pages if certain attributes are disclosed using [React higher order components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html)
- Visualise signing and issuing sessions with React Components
  - This is done with `<Sign /> and <IssueCredentials />`), which handle IRMA sessions by showing a QR code and adapting to user interaction
- Store IRMA-session related information in a [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) reducer
- Makes sure IRMA sessions are correctly handled with a [Background saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/)

# Installation

Diva-react requires React, Redux and Redux-saga.

Installation can be done with:

```
    yarn add https://github.com/alliander/diva-react
```

## Initial setup

Diva-react needs to be added to your existing reducers and sagas. See [diva-js-reference-3p-frontend](https://github.com/Alliander/diva-js-reference-3p-frontend) for an example setup.

### Reducer configuration

To add it to your reducers, do something like this in your `src/reducers/index.js`:

```
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';

import yourOwnReducer from './your-own-reducer';
import { divaReducer } from '../diva-react';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  yourOwnReducer,
  divaReducer,
});

export default rootReducer;
```

You now have access to a divaReducer object in your Redux state, which contains information about running IRMA sessions. Generally it isn't needed to do anything with it, since it's mainly used within Diva-react's components.

### Saga configuration

To add it to your sagas, do something like this in your `src/sagas/index.js`:

```
import { all } from 'redux-saga/effects';

import yourOwnSaga from './yourOwnSaga';
import { divaSaga } from '../diva-react';

export default function* rootSaga() {
  yield all([
    yourOwnSaga(),
    divaSaga(),                   # Optional: pass baseURL as parameter if backend is running on different baseURL
  ]);
}
```

You can now fire `START_SESSION` and `ABANDON_SESSION` redux actions, which will use this saga to start IRMA sessions in the background. Generally it's recommended to use Diva-react's exposed components to start IRMA sessions (instead of firing these actions directly).

`divaSaga()` assumes that the [diva-irma-js](https://github.com/Alliander/diva-irma-js) backend can be found under `/api`. If you use a different host/path for the backend, you can provide a `baseUrl` as an argument do `divaSaga()`. Make sure that you send the right CORS headers in case the backend is running on a different domain.


# Starting IRMA sessions

Once you setup the reducers and sagas correctly, you can import Diva-react components in your views to start IRMA sessions.

## Disclosure

To require attribute disclosure before another page can be seen, use Diva-react's higher order components `WithSimpleDivaAuthorization` or `WithDivaAuthorization` in your route to the original React component.

For instance, if you have a route to a `<MyAccount />` component, the original route:

```
<Route path="/my-account”
	component={ MyAccount }/>
```

becomes

```
import {WithSimpleDivaAuthorization } from 'diva-react';
<Route path="/my-account”
	component={ WithSimpleDivaAuthorization('pbdf.pbdf.email.email')(MyAccount) }/>
```

Now, the `MyAccount` component will only be shown *after* the user has disclosed his/her email address attribute. Any container component can be wrapped with the `WithSimpleDivaAuthorization` component to control identity requirements. See the App container of [diva-js-reference-3p-frontend](https://github.com/Alliander/diva-js-reference-3p-frontend) for an example.

Note: for more complex scenarios, use the `WithDivaAuthorization` higher order component, see the API reference below.

## Signing

To show a QR code to start an IRMA signing session, use the following component:

```
import {Sign } from 'diva-react';
<Sign
  requiredAttributes={required_attributes}
  message={message_to_be_signed}
  viewId="unique_id_for_this_view"
/>
```

The Sign component required three properties:
- `requiredAttributes` contains the list of required attributes in the signature, which is defined as 'a set of conjunctions containing disjunctions', a concept that is explained [at the IRMA webpage](http://credentials.github.io/protocols/irma-protocol/#verification)
- `message` contains the message that will be signed by the user
- `viewId` needs to be a unique id to separate this IRMA session from other running IRMA sessions in the same application


After the IRMA session is completed, an `SESSION_COMPLETED` action will be fired, which results in a `proofResult` and a `signature` object in `divaReducer.sessions['viewId'] (where `viewId` was passed as property to the Sign component). In this way, you can use the `signature` and `proofResult` objects in your React component as properties mapped from the Redux state.

Additionally, you can watch in your sagas for an `SESSION_COMPLETED` event and start another saga. For example:

```
    import { types as divaTypes } from 'diva-react';
    takeEvery(action => action.type === divaTypes.SESSION_COMPLETED && action.viewId === 'your_unique_view_id', yourSaga),
```

## Issuing

To issue new credentials for a user, we define the attributes in the backend instead of the frontend (which is the case with Signing and Disclosure). From there we call [startIssueSession](https://github.com/Alliander/diva-irma-js#exposed-functions-1) from the [diva-irma-js](https://github.com/Alliander/diva-irma-js) NodeJS backend library.

The Diva function `startIssueSession()` needs the credentials that will be issued. These will be defined in the backend, see the [start-irma-session endpoint](https://github.com/Alliander/diva-js-reference-3p-backend/blob/develop/src/actions/start-irma-session.js) from the [diva-js-reference-3p-backend](https://github.com/Alliander/diva-js-reference-3p-backend) for an example.

To connect the to `start-irma-session` endpoint, a `credentialType` parameter is used: `diva-react` will pass the value of this parameter to the backend, where it is matched to a credential (see the`switch` statement in the Diva reference 3p for an example).

To show a QR code to start an IRMA issuing session, use the following component:

```
import { IssueCredentials } from 'diva-react';

const IssueCredentialsPage = () => (
  <IssueCredentials
    viewId="unique_id_for_this_view"
    credentialType="ADDR1"
  />
);
```

In the example above, we send the `ADDR1` credential type to the backend, where it will be mapped to an IRMA credential that can start an IRMA session by returning a QR code.

Like with signing, an `SESSION_COMPLETED` action will be fired.

# API reference

## Saga and reducer
Diva-react exposes a `divaSaga` object that needs to be added to your own sagas (see instructions above). This saga is responsible for starting and handling IRMA sessions. Direct interaction isn't usually needed. However, the following actions can be fired to handle IRMA sessions:

- `START_SESSION`
- `ABANDON_SESSION`

We will explain these actions in detail below.

Diva-react also exposes a `divaReducer` object that needs to be added to your own reducers (see instructions above).

### Redux Reducer types overview

See the actions section for corresponding parameters / input to these types.

*Externally usable*:
- `START_SESSION`
   - Used to start a new IRMA session.
- `SESSION_STARTED`
   - Used to denote that an IRMA session has been successfully started.
   - Contains information that needs to be put into a QR code.
- `SESSION_FAILED_TO_START`
   - Failure case: used when an IRMA cannot be started.
- `ABANDON_SESSION`
   - Used to stop/cancel a running IRMA session. This can for instance be used to stop a running IRMA session if the user leave the page/clicks on something.
- `SESSION_COMPLETED`
   - Used when an IRMA session has been successfully finished (there is data disclosed, signed or issued). This can be used to interact in your application on a successful IRMA session.

## React Components

All components need to be bound to a Redux store that contains the reducer/saga that are described here. In addition, some additional properties can be passed to them, as described here:

- `IssueCredentials` - Used for issuing credentials.
    - `viewId:` Id of the view component (used so that the right view will be updated if we have multiple sessions at the same time). Should be unique per application.
    - `credentialType:` Type of credential that will be issued, see issuing section for example.
- `Sign` - Used for signing messages.
    - `viewId:` Id of the view component (used so that the right view will be updated if we have multiple sessions at the same time). Should be unique per application.
    - `message:` The message that will be signed by the user
    - `requiredAttributes:` contains the list of required attributes in the signature, which is defined as 'a set of conjunctions containing disjunctions', a concept that is explained [at the IRMA webpage](http://credentials.github.io/protocols/irma-protocol/#verification)

For disclosure, two high-order components are available, which will show a QR code if attributes aren't disclosed yet, or show the underlying component if attributes are already disclosed:
- `WithDivaAuthorization` - Default version
    - `viewId:` Id of the view component (used so that the right view will be updated if we have multiple sessions at the same time). Should be unique per application.
    - `attributes:` A dictionary with attributes that are already disclosed. The key is the attribute identifier (for instance `pbdf.pbdf.email.email` for an e-mail attribute issued by the Privacy By Design foundation). The value is the value of the attribute of the user.
    - `requiredAttributes:` A list of attributes that need to be disclosed. This list is an IRMA API Server content object, see the (IRMA documentation)[http://credentials.github.io/protocols/irma-protocol/#verification] for details.
- `WithSimpleDivaAuthorization` - Simplified version that can only request disclosure of one attribute
    - `viewId:` Id of the view component (used so that the right view will be updated if we have multiple sessions at the same time). Should be unique per application.
    - `attributes:` A dictionary with attributes that are already disclosed. The key is the attribute identifier (for instance `pbdf.pbdf.email.email` for an e-mail attribute issued by the Privacy By Design foundation). The value is the value of the attribute of the user.
    - `requiredAttribute:` The identifier of attribute that needs to be disclose.
    - `requiredAttributeLabel:` The label shown to the user when requesting this attribute.
